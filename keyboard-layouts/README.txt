This directory contains .keylayout's created using Ukelele.

UsForSwedes.keylayout is my preferred layout, which is a regular
US keyboard but with Swedish characters åäö where they are found
on a Swedish keyboard, in combination with Option or Command key.

The layouts are installed by copying them to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
and them select them as MacOS keyboard input source.
