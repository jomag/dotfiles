This directory contains .keylayout's created using Ukelele.

UsForSwedes.keylayout is my preferred layout, which is a regular
US keyboard but with Swedish characters åäö where they are found
on a Swedish keyboard, in combination with Option or Command key.

The layouts are installed by copying them to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
and them select them as MacOS keyboard input source. I've found that it
requires a restart of the computer (not just signing out) for it to be
found. The layout will be found in the "Other" category.

It may not be possible to remove all previous layouts from the list
of input sources. Here's a discussion about how it can be done:
